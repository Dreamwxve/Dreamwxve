  <strong>ðŸ¤” Who am I? ðŸ¤”</strong>
</h1>
<p>
  I am an 18-year-old Australian who was always interested in coding, programming, and electronics ever since a young age. Among making my own projects, I also enjoy jumping in on other people's projects. If youâ€™ve got something that needs a bit of tweaking or could use some extra help, Iâ€™m here to pitch in. Itâ€™s all about sharing skills and making things better together! I love learning new things along the way to improve my skillset.
